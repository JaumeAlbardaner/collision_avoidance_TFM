# Collision Avoidance for Bumper Cars

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my master's thesis project titled "Collision Avoidance for Bumper Cars." The project focuses on simulating N bumper cars traveling around a squared arena, with the primary goal of implementing and comparing different collision avoidance methods.
